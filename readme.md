5s Audit App

To run app for the first time, please install NodeJS package manager on: https://nodejs.org/dist/v12.13.0/node-v12.13.0-x64.msi

then navigate to your folder by terminal and run command "npm install"

if the terminal return errors, maybe you have to install angular and ionic cli too:
run these additional commands:

"npm i @angular/cli" and "npm install -g ionic"

Then run "ionic serve" to run the project on your default browser

If you want to run this on a native Device (mobile phones or tablets), you need to install Cordova or Capacitor, follow the instruction of Ionic documentation to finish the process: "https://ionicframework.com/docs/cli/commands/build"
